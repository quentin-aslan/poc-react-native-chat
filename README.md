This is a Proof of Concept (POC) real-time chat application developed using React Native for the frontend and Supabase for the backend. The goal of this project was to learn how to use these technologies to build a chat application that utilizes Supabase to handle data synchronization between users.

React Native is a popular framework for building mobile applications, while Supabase is an open-source backend as a service (BaaS) platform that provides easy-to-use APIs for building real-time applications.

üöÄ Overall, this POC has helped me to improve my mobile development skills and gain experience in building real-time chat applications using modern technologies.
